# Natours
Natours is a website for a tourism company. It was purposely built without any modern CSS techniques like flexbox and grid, **JUST with pure old CSS**.

This project was part of the Advanced Css and Sass Udemy Course by Jonas Schedtmann and focused on using as many CSS properties as possible, following **7 - 1 CSS Architecture** and **BEM Methodology** for writing CSS codes.
